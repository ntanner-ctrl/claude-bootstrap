# Plugin Enhancers — Registry & Detection Protocol

Reference command for plugin-to-workflow integration. Workflow commands (blueprint, review, dispatch) read this file at their plugin integration seams to determine what enhancements are available.

> **Users do not invoke this command directly.** It is read by other workflow commands at decision points.

---

## Section 1: Detection Protocol

All commands MUST use this exact protocol. No ad-hoc detection.

```
PLUGIN DETECTION PROTOCOL

Step 1: Read ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json
  - If file doesn't exist → no plugins installed, skip all enhancements
  - If file exists but read takes >3 seconds → abort detection, skip all enhancements
  - If JSON parsing fails → log "[PLUGIN] installed_plugins.json parse failed: <error>; skipping all enhancements", skip all enhancements

Step 2: Extract plugin names from the "plugins" object keys
  - Key format: "<plugin-name>@<marketplace-name>"
  - Extract the plugin name: everything BEFORE the first "@"
  - Match EXACTLY on the extracted prefix (not substring)
    Example: "pr-review-toolkit" matches "pr-review-toolkit@claude-code-plugins"
             "pr-review" does NOT match "pr-review-toolkit@claude-code-plugins"

Step 3: For each plugin needed at this seam, check if its extracted name exists
  - If detected → offer its capabilities (see slot mapping below)
  - If NOT detected → silently skip (no error, no warning, no log)
  - If detected but not in this registry → log "[PLUGIN] <name> installed but not in registry; skipping"

TIMEOUT: 3 seconds for file read. FALLBACK: Skip all enhancements.
```

**If this file (plugin-enhancers.md) does not exist:** Skip all plugin integration. Do not error. Workflow commands MUST check for this file's existence before attempting to read it.

## Section 3: Plugin-to-Slot Mapping

### pr-review-toolkit (Phase 1)

**Fills:** `review:specialized`
**Tested with:** v1.0.0 (claude-code-plugins marketplace)
**Detection:** Check installed_plugins.json for key with prefix "pr-review-toolkit"

**Agents:**
- `pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter` — Identifies silent failures, inadequate error handling, inappropriate fallbacks
- `pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer` — Analyzes type design for encapsulation, invariant expression, usefulness
- `pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer` — Reviews test coverage quality and completeness
- `pr-review-toolkit:comment-analyzer` — Checks comment accuracy, completeness, maintainability
- `pr-review-toolkit:code-simplifier` — Identifies simplification opportunities
- `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer` — Reviews for bugs, logic errors, security, code quality, conventions

**Invocation:**
```
Task(
  subagent_type: "pr-review-toolkit:<agent-name>",
  prompt: "<review context + file paths>"
)
```

Each agent receives: file paths to review + context summary.
Results: markdown format, advisory only.

**Dispatch rules:**
- Fast-fail probe: Before dispatching all 6 agents, dispatch ONE agent with a 10-second timeout.
  If the probe fails, skip remaining agents. Log: "[PLUGIN] pr-review-toolkit probe failed; skipping all agents"
- After probe succeeds: dispatch remaining agents in parallel (5-minute timeout per agent).
- Results: max 2000 tokens per agent. If exceeded, truncate and append `[truncated]`.

**If agent dispatch fails:**
  Log: `[PLUGIN] pr-review-toolkit:<agent> dispatch failed: <error>`
  User message: `Note: <agent> unavailable (dispatch failed), skipping.`
  Action: Skip this agent, continue with remaining agents.

**If agent times out:**
  Log: `[PLUGIN] pr-review-toolkit:<agent> timeout: 5m exceeded`
  User message: `Note: <agent> unavailable (timeout after 5min), skipping.`
  Action: Kill agent, continue with remaining agents.

## Section 4: Graceful Degradation Rules

1. **Plugin not installed:** Slot not offered. No error, no warning, no log.
2. **Plugin installed but agent dispatch fails:** Log failure, skip agent, continue workflow. Show user: `Note: [agent] unavailable (dispatch failed), skipping.`
3. **Plugin returns oversized output (>2000 tokens):** Truncate to 2000 tokens, append `[truncated — full output available via direct plugin invocation]`.
4. **Multiple plugins fill same slot:** Offer all as options, ordered alphabetically by plugin name.
5. **Detection file missing or unparseable:** Skip all enhancements. Log: `[PLUGIN] installed_plugins.json not found or corrupted; skipping plugin detection`
6. **Detection exceeds 3-second timeout:** Abort, proceed without enhancements.
7. **Circuit breaker — 3 consecutive failures from same plugin:** Abort remaining agents for that plugin. Log: `[PLUGIN] Circuit breaker: 3 consecutive failures from <plugin>; skipping remaining agents` Show user: `Plugin enhancements temporarily disabled due to repeated failures.` Circuit breaker is session-scoped — resets automatically when a new session begins.

---

## Section 5: Plugin Results Format

All plugin results MUST be formatted as:

```markdown
### [plugin-review] <plugin-name>: <agent-name>

**Findings:**
- [severity: high] Description of finding (file:line)
- [severity: medium] Description of finding (file:line)

**Summary:** N findings (N high, N medium, N low)
```

**Size limit:** Max 2000 tokens per agent result. Truncate with `[truncated]` note if exceeded.

**Tag:** `[plugin-review]` enables filtering. Plugin results are distinguished from debate chain findings:
- Debate chain findings CAN trigger regressions
- Plugin review findings CANNOT trigger regressions

**"Advisory" semantics:** Plugin results are surfaced to the user for awareness. They are appended to the relevant output (adversarial.md, review summary, dispatch report). They do NOT block workflow progression. They do NOT affect confidence scoring. They do NOT trigger regression logic. The user may act on them or ignore them.

---

## Section 6: Logging Protocol

### Responsibility
The **workflow command** that invokes the plugin is responsible for logging. Never rely on the plugin to log its own failure.

### Format
```
[PLUGIN] <plugin-name>:<agent-name> <event>: <detail>
```

### Events
```
[PLUGIN] Detection: found <plugin>@<version>
[PLUGIN] <plugin>:<agent> dispatched
[PLUGIN] <plugin>:<agent> completed: <tokens> tokens
[PLUGIN] <plugin>:<agent> timeout: 5m exceeded
[PLUGIN] <plugin>:<agent> dispatch failed: <error>
[PLUGIN] <plugin>:<agent> failed: <reason>
[PLUGIN] <plugin> probe failed; skipping all agents
[PLUGIN] Circuit breaker: 3 consecutive failures from <plugin>; skipping remaining agents
[PLUGIN] installed_plugins.json not found or corrupted; skipping plugin detection
[PLUGIN] <name> installed but not in registry; skipping
```

### Destinations
1. **Empirica** (if session active): `deadend_log` for failures, `finding_log` for successful plugin insights
2. **User-facing**: One-line note in workflow output
3. **If Empirica unavailable**: Stderr only (fail-open, no file creation)

### What's NOT logged
- Successful detection (silent — reduces noise)
- Plugin results content (already in output files)
- Per-token metrics (out of scope for Phase 1)

## Section 7: Dispatch Lenses for /dispatch

When `/dispatch` runs with `--lenses`, these additional lenses are available from installed plugins:

**pr-review-toolkit lenses:**

| Lens Name | Agent | Requires Plugin |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| `silent-failures` | pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter | pr-review-toolkit |
| `types` | pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer | pr-review-toolkit |
| `comments` | pr-review-toolkit:comment-analyzer | pr-review-toolkit |
| `simplify` | pr-review-toolkit:code-simplifier | pr-review-toolkit |
| `test-coverage` | pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer | pr-review-toolkit |

**Additional plugin lenses:**

| Lens Name | Agent | Requires Plugin | Complements |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| `deep-security` | security-pro:security-auditor | security-pro | Standard `security` lens |
| `deep-perf` | performance-optimizer:performance-engineer | performance-optimizer | Standard `perf` lens |
| `methodology` | superpowers:code-reviewer | superpowers | Standard quality review |
| `conventions` | feature-dev:code-reviewer | feature-dev | Standard quality review |

**Lens complementarity:** The `deep-security` and `deep-perf` lenses are more thorough than the standard `security` and `perf` lenses (which use built-in agents). Users can run both: `--lenses security,deep-security` for maximum coverage. The standard lens provides a quick scan; the plugin lens provides a deep audit.

If a user requests an extended lens and the required plugin is not installed:
```
Lens '<name>' requires <plugin> plugin (not installed).
Proceeding with standard lenses only.
```
