# CLAUDE.md Refresh

Think about what's changed since the last assessment.

## Context

Review the existing CLAUDE.md, then:

1. **Scan for drift**
   - Check if documented commands still work
   - Look for new directories or major files not mentioned
   - Identify new dependencies added since last update
   - Note any new patterns emerging in recent files (check git log if available)

2. **Validate current content**
   - Flag anything in CLAUDE.md that's now outdated or wrong
   - Identify documented patterns that are no longer followed

3. **Identify gaps**
   - What have I been repeatedly figuring out in recent sessions that should be documented?
   - Any new complexity or areas requiring guidance?

## Output

Provide:

1. **Recommended updates** — specific changes to existing CLAUDE.md content
2. **Recommended additions** — new sections or information to add
3. **Recommended removals** — outdated content to delete
4. **A diff-style summary** showing what changed

If the project has grown significantly in scope or complexity, recommend running the full `/assess-project` instead.
